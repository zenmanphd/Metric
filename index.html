        <p class="rant"> Hello and welcome to my humble little corner of the internet. 
            While youâ€™re here please allow me to share my glorious vision for the future, 
            which is of course the future of an America that embraces the metric system.  

            For centuries we have been swept up in a reckless love affair with antiquated 
            units of measurement like inches, gallons, and pounds. At a time when information 
            flows freely from one end of the equator to the other in a fraction of a second; 
            the pace of technological innovation has increased exponentially. 
            And yet, we still cling ceremoniously to the last keepsake of monastic rule,
            the Brittish imperial system of measurement. So, with great irony, the one true way 
            to celebrate our independence from Great Britain would be to join the rest of the world in
            utilizing a modern system of measurement which the Brittish have even adopted themselves.
