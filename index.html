        <p class="rant1"> Hello and welcome to my humble little corner of the internet. 
            While you are here, allow me to share my glorious vision for the future. 
            That is of course, the future of an America that embraces the metric system. 
            For centuries we have been swept up in a reckless love affair with antiquated 
            units of measurement like inches, gallons, and pounds. At a time when information 
            flows freely from one end of the equator to the other in a fraction of a second; 
            the pace of technological innovation has increased exponentially. And yet, we still 
            cling ceremoniously to the last keepsake of monastic rule, the British imperial system of measurement. 
            So, with great irony, the one true way to celebrate our independence from Great Britain would be to 
            join the rest of the world in utilizing a modern system of measurement which the British have also adopted.

        <p class="rant2"> Ultimately, the British system’s only flaw is that it is outdated, sharing its origins 
            and methodologies with what many ancient cultures did at the time. Measurements in the ancient world were 
            often improvised, tailored to the problem at hand. To establish units of measurements on the fly our savvy 
            ancestors used what was around, which more often than not, was their own body parts. In the time of pharaohs 
            and pyramids the cubit reigned supreme. It was based on the length of a man’s forearm, the standard of which 
            would later be set as the “Royal cubit. Often it was often the person in charge who took over the responsibility 
            for setting the standard. Perhaps that’s why we call them rulers. (Just a thought).</p>
