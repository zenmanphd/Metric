        <p class="rant1"> Hello and welcome to my humble little corner of the internet. 
            While you are here, allow me to share my glorious vision for the future. 
            That is of course, the future of an America that embraces the metric system. 
            For centuries we have been swept up in a reckless love affair with antiquated 
            units of measurement like inches, gallons, and pounds. At a time when information 
            flows freely from one end of the equator to the other in a fraction of a second; 
            the pace of technological innovation has increased exponentially. And yet, we still 
            cling ceremoniously to the last keepsake of monastic rule, the British imperial system of measurement. 
            So, with great irony, the one true way to celebrate our independence from Great Britain would be to 
            join the rest of the world in utilizing a modern system of measurement which the British have also adopted. 
            So my faceless digital friends, it is my proud honor to usher you toward the path of enlightenment, one liter, 
            milligram, and cubic centimeter at a time.
