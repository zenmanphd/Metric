    <h2>and now...a brief poem about the city..</h2>3
        <p>It sounded French, but then they were so far away...the briskly walking crowd of three 
            snapping clumsy photographs of buildings towering above. Their foreign model cellphones 
            shaped like shiny thin plastic spaceships. Propelled by cat-like curiousity Eastbound on 13th street.
            A well-groomed young professional drains his undrunk coffee in the bushes. His body curving inward like 
            a crescent moon to dodge the dark roast splashing on his off-white khakis.</p>
