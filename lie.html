        Why should we adopt some fussy new measurements that would only complicate our rich 
        American way of life and “inch” us dangerously close to the snare of global conformity? 
        We hard-working Americans are far too busy setting olympic world records, brewing craft 
        beer, and setting an example for the world to crowd our minds with pointless meters, 
        liters, and grams. Besides, why should we re-invent the wheel when so much of this great 
        nation has already been built with American made, U.S. customary units (previously the 
        British imperial system). The American people do not need a math lesson in decimal 
        conversion. Everyone here intuitively knows what 3 feet looks like. We can easily 
        comprehend a distance of 30 miles, because the speed limit on the interstate tells us 
        that if we are driving at a pace of 60 miles per hour, then it will take us 30 minutes 
        to get there. The police in any town can recognize a suspect as being 5ft 7in tall 
        because generations of Americans dating back to the original 13 colonies have described 
        height in this way. Our conventional units don’t just influence how we measure things, 
        but how we think, communicate, and interact with each other.
