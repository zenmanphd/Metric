        Putting the theatrics aside, it is rather unfair to insinuate that the United States has stubbornly held onto 
        all of the conventional measurements of the British imperial system. It is not like we never modernized. However, 
        while the majority of the world (everyone country except Liberia, Myanmar, and ourselves) has officially adopted 
        the Metric or S.I. units, we would further adapt and standardize British imperial units. Thus, the old system would 
        transform into what we refer to today as the U.S.C or United States customary units.
        
        Ultimately, the British system’s only flaw is that it is outdated, sharing its origins 
        and methodologies with what many ancient cultures did at the time. Measurements in the ancient world were 
        often improvised, tailored to the problem at hand. To establish units of measurements on the fly our savvy 
        ancestors used what was around, which more often than not, was their own body parts. In the time of pharaohs 
        and pyramids the cubit reigned supreme. It was based on the length of a man’s forearm, the standard of which 
        would later be set as the “Royal cubit. Often it was the person in charge who took over the responsibility 
        for setting the standard. Perhaps that’s why we call them rulers. (Just a thought).
